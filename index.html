          <h1>Inception of Major Social Media Networks</h1>
          <div class="narration">
            <p>We will first look at how social media networks have grown from its inception. With a total global population of <b>7.7 billion</b> there are atleast <b>3.3 billion</b> people online. 
              It is reported that Facebook alone has reached <b>2.5 billion</b> monthly active users.
            </p>
            <p>Social media networks such as MySpace who dominated the space has disappeared by 2008 and competitors such as Facebook has remained dominant in the last decade.</p>
            <p>The below chart depicts the growth of the prominent social media networks. 
              You can drill down on a particular year using the slider as well as see their growth from 2004 to 2018 as an animation using the <kbd>Play</kbd> button.</p>

          <h1>Use of Social Media Platforms by Gender (US), 2019</h1>

          <p>For some platforms the gender differences are very large. The share of women who use Pinterest is more than twice as high as the share of men using this platform. For Reddit it is the other way around, the share of men is almost twice as high. </p>

          <h1>Daily hours spent with digital media, United States, 2008 to 2018</h1>
          <p>The increase in social media use over the last decade has, of course, come together with a large increase in the amount of time that people spend online.</p>

          <div id="chart3"></div>

          <p>As we can see, the average for the OECD is more than 4 hours per day, and in some countries the average is above 6 hours per day.</p>
          <p>In the US, adults spend more than 6 hours per day on digital media (apps and websites accessed through mobile phones, tablets, computers and other connected devices such as game consoles). As the chart shows, this growth has been driven almost entirely by additional time spent on smartphones and tablets.</p>
