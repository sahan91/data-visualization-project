          <h1>Monthly Active Users on Social Media Platforms - Worldwide</h1>
          <p>Most of the social media platforms that survived the last decade have shifted significantly in what they offer users. Twitter, for example, didnâ€™t allow users to upload videos or images in the beginning. Since 2011 this is possible and today more than 50% of the content viewed on Twitter includes images and videos.</p>

          <h1>Use of Social Media Platforms by Gender (US), 2019</h1>
          <p>In this chart we show the percentage of men and women who use different platforms in the US. The diagonal line marks parity;  so sites above the diagonal line are those more popular among men and sites below are those more popular among women. (Bubble sizes are proportional to the total number of users of each platform.)</p>

          <p>For some platforms the gender differences are very large. The share of women who use Pinterest is more than twice as high as the share of men using this platform. For Reddit it is the other way around, the share of men is almost twice as high. </p>

          <h1>Daily hours spent with digital media, United States, 2008 to 2018</h1>
          <p>The increase in social media use over the last decade has, of course, come together with a large increase in the amount of time that people spend online.</p>

          <div id="chart3"></div>

          <p>As we can see, the average for the OECD is more than 4 hours per day, and in some countries the average is above 6 hours per day.</p>
          <p>In the US, adults spend more than 6 hours per day on digital media (apps and websites accessed through mobile phones, tablets, computers and other connected devices such as game consoles). As the chart shows, this growth has been driven almost entirely by additional time spent on smartphones and tablets.</p>
